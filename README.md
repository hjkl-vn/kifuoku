# Kifu-oku (棋譜憶)


Kifu-oku (棋譜憶) is a coined Japanese term combining 棋譜 (kifu), meaning "game record" with 憶 (oku), meaning "to remember" or "recollect", the same character found in 記憶 (kioku, "memory"). Together, 棋譜憶 suggests "recalling game records" or "kifu memory."

While Kifu-oku (棋譜憶) is not a word you'll find in a dictionary, the construction follows natural Japanese compounding patterns and its meaning is immediately apparent to readers familiar with the characters.

My friend, Nobu, said this name was great. I trust her.
